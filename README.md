## Guess the Number Game

This repository contains a simple yet fun Python-based game called "Guess the Number." The game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. It's a great example of basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling in Python.

### Features

- **Random Number Generation**: The game generates a random number within a defined range.
- **User Interaction**: Players input their guesses and receive feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Input Validation**: The game checks for invalid inputs and prompts the user to enter a valid number.
- **Replay Option**: After guessing the number, players can choose to play again or exit the game.
